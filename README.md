# STM32 Portable Driver Library

**A personal learning project to build reusable, portable drivers for STM32 microcontrollers.**

## 🎯 Project Goal

Build a collection of well-documented, portable drivers that work across:
- STM32F1 series (F103, F105)
- STM32L4 series (L431)
- STM32G0 series (G030)
